# Dotfile
My personal dotfiles.

# Prerequisits

* git
* xcode
* brew
* iTerm with [solarized theme](https://github.com/altercation/solarized/tree/master/iterm2-colors-solarized)

# Installation
You can install the dotfiles by typing 

    source <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/instilled/.dotfiles/master/install.sh)
    
at your shell. This should install itself and all its dependencies. You should now configure
iTerms to use the correct color schema and font. This is a per profile setting.
